1.PROJECT TITLE
Basic Password Strength Checker
2. Aim of the Project
The aim of this project is to create a Basic Password Strength Checker using C language that checks whether a password entered by the user is valid 
or not based on certain conditions.
3. Problem Statement
In today’s digital world, password security is very important.
This project checks the strength of a password by verifying:
Minimum length of password
Presence of at least one digit
Presence of at least one uppercase letter
4. Why This Project Is Created
This project is created to:
Understand string handling in C
Learn password validation logic
Practice loops, conditions, and functions
Get idea of how real login systems validate passwords
5. Language and Tools Used
Programming Language: C
Compiler: GCC / Turbo C
Platform: Windows / Linux
6. Concepts Used
Character arrays (Strings)
Loops (for)
Conditional statements (if-else)
User-defined functions
String traversal
7. Algorithm
Start
Ask the user to enter a password
Read the password using scanf()
Pass the password to validation function
Check minimum length of password
Check if at least one digit is present
Check if at least one uppercase letter is present
If all conditions are satisfied, password is valid
Else password is invalid
Stop
8. Program Logic Explanation
The password is stored in a character array
A function validatePassword() is created
strlen() is used to check length
Loop is used to check each character
isdigit() checks digit
isupper() checks uppercase letter
Function returns success or failure
9. Utility of the Project
Useful for basic login/signup systems
Helps beginners understand password security
Can be used in college projects
Improves logic-building skills
10. What I Learned From This Project
From this project, I learned:
How to work with strings in C
How to use loops for string traversal
How to use character checking functions
How to create and call user-defined functions
How validation works in real-life applications
11. Future Scope
In future, this project can be enhanced by:
Adding special character validation
Showing specific error messages
Password masking
Creating full login system
Storing passwords securely
12. Conclusion
This project successfully checks the strength of a password using basic conditions.
It improves understanding of C programming concepts and security logic.
