# Basic Password Strength Checker

## 1. Project Title
**Basic Password Strength Checker**

---

## 2. Aim of the Project
The aim of this project is to create a Basic Password Strength Checker using C language that checks whether a password entered by the user is valid or not based on certain conditions.

---

## 3. Problem Statement
In today’s digital world, password security is very important.  
This project checks the strength of a password by verifying:
- Minimum length of password  
- Presence of at least one digit  
- Presence of at least one uppercase letter  

---

## 4. Why This Project Is Created
This project is created to:
- Understand string handling in C  
- Learn password validation logic  
- Practice loops, conditions, and functions  
- Get an idea of how real login systems validate passwords  

---

## 5. Language and Tools Used
- **Programming Language:** C  
- **Compiler:** GCC / Turbo C  
- **Platform:** Windows / Linux  

---

## 6. Concepts Used
- Character arrays (Strings)  
- Loops (`for`)  
- Conditional statements (`if-else`)  
- User-defined functions  
- String traversal  

---

## 7. Algorithm
1. Start  
2. Ask the user to enter a password  
3. Read the password using `scanf()`  
4. Pass the password to validation function  
5. Check minimum length of password  
6. Check if at least one digit is present  
7. Check if at least one uppercase letter is present  
8. If all conditions are satisfied, password is valid  
9. Else password is invalid  
10. Stop  

---

## 8. Program Logic Explanation
- The password is stored in a character array  
- A function `validatePassword()` is created  
- `strlen()` is used to check length  
- Loop is used to check each character  
- `isdigit()` checks digit  
- `isupper()` checks uppercase letter  
- Function returns success or failure  

---

## 9. Utility of the Project
- Useful for basic login/signup systems  
- Helps beginners understand password security  
- Can be used in college projects  
- Improves logic-building skills  

---

## 10. What I Learned From This Project
From this project, I learned:
- How to work with strings in C  
- How to use loops for string traversal  
- How to use character checking functions  
- How to create and call user-defined functions  
- How validation works in real-life applications  

---

## 11. Future Scope
In future, this project can be enhanced by:
- Adding special character validation  
- Showing specific error messages  
- Password masking  
- Creating full login system  
- Storing passwords securely  

---

## 12. Conclusion
This project successfully checks the strength of a password using basic conditions.  
It improves understanding of C programming concepts and security logic.
